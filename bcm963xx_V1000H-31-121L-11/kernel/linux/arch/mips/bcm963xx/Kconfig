           Since most/all of our interrupt handlers disable interrupts
           during interrupt handling with the IRQF_DISABLED flag, Linux
           cannot track time spent in hardirq handling with the normal
           tick sampling mechanism.  This option enables code to count
           cycles spent in hardirq and adds a tick to kernel_stat.irq
           when the number of cycles spent reaches 1 tick.  This mechanism 
           is similar to CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING
